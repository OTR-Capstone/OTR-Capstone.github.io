### Our Project Goals

Raiways account for one third of U.S. exports, making them a vital economic resouce. Just in the last eight years alone, the industry has suffered 2 billion USD in damages from railway accidents, ranging from preventable railyard mishaps to tragic railroad crossing collisions involving motorists. Our team of Data Scientists will make a Classification model to predict what railway company, and under what conditions, is most likely to be involved in these accidents. We feel that this information would be invaluable to both the industry and insurance companies.
