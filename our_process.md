# Our Process

Each member of the team performed individual analysis of selected datasets, then the team collectively compared notes and identified areas where the data was sufficient enough to provide insights. As graduates of the [Codeup Data Science](https://codeup.com/ds-admissions/) program, the team members are all versed in Python. Python libraries used extensively include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The team utilized Zoom, Slack, Google, Tableau, and GitHub heavily for collaboration.
